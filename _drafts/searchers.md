Cairn, but with only HP, AC, MV (no ability scores).

STR - used for combat, similar to extra HP, but also saves
DEX - used for initiative
WIS - used for spellcasting, morale

What if...

- eliminate STR, DEX, WIS
- HP 0 = death. give extra hp to compensate.
- Have single saving throw for death saves, etc
- Have MV / move / speed score for initiative, moves, fleeing, etc
- spellcasting is either vancian or cast from hp

| Armor | DR | MV |
|-------|----|----|
| None  | 0  | 12 |
| Light | 1  | 9  |
| Heavy | 2  | 6  |

Roll under MV to act before monsters, flee, etc.
