**Goal**: Run a modern-day zombie apocalypse game set in my city.

## Requirements

1. A local map at an appropriate level of detail.
    - Not foot-by-foot resolution, but block-by-block? Neighborhood-by-neighborhood?
    - County road map may be sufficient.
2. Procedures for common things that players will want to do:
    - Move around the city.
    - Scavenge for supplies.
    - Fight zombies.
    - Fight humans.
    - Build a base.
    - Survive the weather.
3. Simple, unified dice mechanics (2d6? d6? d20?)[^1]
4. Fast character generation with bonds.
    - Fast to lessen the interruption due to character death.
    - Bonds to get dramatic hooks with minimal effort.

## Core Mechanic

DM decides whether a task is Easy or Hard, and defines what the risk is if you fail. Roll 2d6+bonus. Get equal to or greater than 8+ for Easy, 10+ for Hard to succeed. Cannot apply more than +4 to roll.

Table below shows chance of success with various difficulty levels and bonuses.

| Bonus | Easy Task (8+) | Hard Task (10+) |
|-------|----------------|-----------------|
| +0    | 42%            | 17%             |
| +1    | 58%            | 28%             |
| +2    | 72%            | 42%             |
| +3    | 83%            | 58%             |
| +4    | 92%            | 72%             |

## Character Creation

Skills:

- Military (shooting, fire and maneuver, explosives)
- Medical (first aid, nursing, medications / Rx)
- Engineering (construction, mechanics, engine maintenance)
- Criminal (picking locks, scavenging in urban areas, hotwiring cars)
- Hunter (hunting & fishing, foraging in rural areas, stealth)
- Farmer (growing food, raising livestock, predicting the weather)

[^1]: I don't like d10 or d100 because the d10 is not a Platonic Solid ðŸ˜¤
