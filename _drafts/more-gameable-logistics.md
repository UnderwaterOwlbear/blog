## armies

for gaming purposes, limit armies to one of three size categories

- a *legion*, comprised of approximately 5,000 men
- a *small army*, comprised of approximately 10,000 men
- a *large army*, comprised of approximately 20,000 men

armies larger than 20,000 men were occasionally seen in the ancient and gunpowder periods, but could only operate in areas of exceptionally high population density.

troops can carry about 1 week of supplies on their backs. adding a wagon train will double this endurance to 2 weeks, but the army will only be able to move along roads.

harsh environments (deserts, tundra) halve this endurance due to the additional food and water that must be carried.

an army can move 12 mi per day, and must rest 1 day each week (therefore, 72 miles per week)

## foraging

an army can extend its endurance by foraging from the countryside. when on campaign in the spring and summer, and not under harassment by the enemy, the minimum population densities required to sustain an army on the march without dipping into its stores are as follows 

- a *legion* requires a population density of at least 4 people per sqmi
- a *small army* requires a population density of at least 8 people per sqmi
- a *large army* requires a population density of at least 16 people per sqmi

typical population densities encountered are:
- 0 people per sqmi is *barrens* such as deserts and tundras
- 2 people per sqmi is *wilderness* such as untamed forests or hills
- 4 people per sqmi is *borderland* such as logging forests and isolated farms
- 8 people per sq is the *hinterland*, with villages and large farms on good arable land
- 16 people per sqmi is *settled* land, with some large towns
- 32 people per sqmi is the *heartland*, typically home to large cities
- 64 people per sqmi is *urban*, not typically found in most countries save for the ancient urban powers around the Mediterranean

for medieval-Europe-ish settings, population densities are typically around 4 to 16 people per sqmi, with only some countries achieving 32 people per sqmi.

positive modifiers to this include:
- if the army has a cavalry wing, halve the population density required (as cavalry can forage further away from the main force)
- if the army is willing to brutally sack the countryside and take twice the amount of food from the peasantry (thereby risking a peasant uprising and winter starvation), halve the population density required

negative modifiers to this include:
- if campaigning in the fall or winter, double the population density required
- if the enemy is harassing your foraging parties (such as when within 30 miles of a castle with cavalry, or within 15 miles of one without), double the population density required

if an army is foraging in a region with the required population density, it will not deplete its stores. if it is foraging in a region with half the required population density, it depletes supplies at half rate. if foraging in an area with one quarter or less of the population density required, the army must consume its stores (from backpacks or wagon trains)

if an army stays in one place, it will deplete the food from the surrounding countryside. for each week the army is in one location, halve the effective population density of the area (for the purposes of determining food requirements). some peasants will likely starve in the winter.

areas depleted due to foraging will recover their food stores during the next harvest the following year.

when an army has no supplies remaining, it must test morale/loyalty. on a failure, the army immediately disbands. on a success, it will hold together one more week (perhaps an opportunity forage more supplies), then disband.
