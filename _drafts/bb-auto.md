## Character Creation

### Rules Summary

If coming from other old-school games, these are the assumptions used for a few important rules:

- _Into the Odd_-style combat (auto-hit attack rolls).
- _Wonder & Wickedness_-style spellcasting
- Level-based HP
- Single saving throw (roll-over) with a d20.
- 2d6 morale and reaction

**Advantage & Disadvantage** When a character has advantage on a d20 roll (typically a saving throw), roll two dice instead of one and take the better result. When a character has disadvantage on a roll, roll two dice instead of one and take the worse result.

**Impaired & Enhanced** When a character's damage roll is enhanced, increase its size by one step. When a character's damage roll is impaired, reduce its size by one step.

### Experience & Advancement

Pick a class. Start at 1st level with...

- 6 hit points (HP)
- 0 experience points (XP)
- 3d6 silver pieces (sp)

Gain 1 XP for every sp spent on carousing, partying, donating, gambling, or other pursuits without material reward. Slaying monsters may award XP as well, but this is significantly more dangerous and less rewarding than stealing treasure.

## Equipment

### Encumbrance & Movement

**Unencumbered Load** A person can carry up to ten (10) items. Some items are **bulky** -- these require two hands to carry or wield, and count as two items for encumbrance purposes. Some items are **tiny** -- any number of the same type of **tiny** items fit into the same slot. A purse of 300 coins takes up one slot.

**Encumbered Load** A person can carry up to an additional ten (10) items (for a total of twenty). When they are carrying more than ten items, they are **encumbered**, and movement speed is halved.  

**Mounts** When mounted, movement speed in combat is doubled.

### Items

| Armor        | DR | Cost    | Encumbrance as... | Examples / Notes                           |
|--------------|----|---------|-------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| Unarmored    | 0  | -       | -                 | -                                          |

Table: Armor and Shields

**Note:** DR from armor and shields cannot exceed 2.

| Weapon  | Damage | Special          | Cost | Examples                    |
|---------|--------|------------------|------|-----------------------------|

| Unarmed | 1      |                  | -    |                             |

Table: Weapons

**Hand** weapons are wielded in one hand, and may be thrown.  
**Bulky** weapons must be wielded in two hands, in addition to counting as two items for encumbrance purposes.  
**Missile** weapons may be loosed in the missile phase of combat, and require ammunition. Roll a d6 after each combat in which a missile weapon was used. On a 1 or 2, you are out of ammo.  

| Transport   | Cost     |
|:------------|---------:|
| Cart, hand  | 5sp      |
| Cart, draft | 10sp     |
| Wagon       | 30sp     |
| Mule        | 30sp     |
| Horse       | 50sp     |
| Warhorse    | 100sp    |
| Canoe       | 50sp     |
| Longship    | 10,000sp |

Table: Transportaion

**Carts** double (2x) the carrying capacity of the user.  
**Wagons** quadruple (4x) the carrying capacity of the user.  
**Mules** have a morale score of 7, and are only as fast as a walking person. Can carry 30 items unencumbered, or 60 items when encumbered. They require 1 unit of supply per day.  
**Horses** have a morale score of 6, and double movement speed. They can carry 40 items unencumbered, or 80 items when encumbered. A rider counts as 20 items (max 2 riders). They require 4 units of supply per day.  
**Warhorses** are as horses, but have a morale score of 9.  
**Canoe** Carries 2 men and 300 items of cargo, counts as a **bulky** item when portaging.  
**Longships** can carry 40 oarsmen, and sail at speeds of 10 mph.  

### Hirelings

It costs 25sp to place an advertisement in a settlement for hirelings. The advertisement lasts for 1 week and provides d6-2 prospects for hiring. Hirelings are not brave or foolhardy enough to enter dungeons, but can be used for logistical support to and from dungeons and for guarding camp.

| Type           | Notes                   | Cost per Month |
|:---------------|:-----------------------------|---------------:|
| Servant        | HDÂ½ AC10 M6  | 4sp            |

## Encounters & Combat

### Distance

Wandering monster encounters take place at the following distance, depending on location and whether any parties are surprised.

|               | Indoor         | Outdoor        |
|---------------|----------------|----------------|
| Surprised     | 1 move away    | 1d4 moves away |
| Not Surprised | 1d4 moves away | 4d6 moves away |

Table: Distance of Encounters

### Reactions

When encountering a wandering monster or other entity, and their disposition is unknown, roll 2d6 to determine their reaction.

| 2d6  | Reaction     |
|:----:|:-------------|
| 2-   | Hostile      |
| 3-5  | Negative     |
| 6-8  | Uncertain    |
| 9-11 | Positive     |
| 12+  | Enthusiastic |

Table: Reaction Roll Results

### Initiative & Phases

To determine initiative within the combat round, each side rolls a d6 at the start of combat, adding any applicable bonuses per the table below. The higher result has the initiative.

| Situation                      | Init. Modifier |
|--------------------------------|----------------|
| Party has no light sources     | -1             |
| Smaller party (by at least 2-to-1) | +1             |
| Undetected party               | +2             |

Table: Initiative Modifiers

Combatants take their actions in the following phases, with the side having the initiative acting first in each phase.

**Phases:**

1. Magic, cast
2. Missile
3. Move
4. Melee
5. Magic, effect

**Casting Interruptions** A spellcaster who is hit by an attack while casting a spell must make a saving throw. If he fails, the spell is lost (as if it were cast) and no effect takes place.

**Moving and Missiles** A combatant who looses a missile in the missile phase cannot move during the move phase.

### Attacks & Damage

**Basic Attacks** Roll your weapon's damage die, and subtract any DR that your target possesses. You deal that much damage to your target.

**Charge** In the first round of combat, a combatant may charge an enemy by moving from outside of melee range to within melee range of an enemy in the movement phase. The charging combatant deals _enhanced_ damage on their next attack against the charged enemy.

**Withdraw** When a combatant within melee range of an enemy moves out of melee range, the enemy may immediately make a melee attack against the combatant. This can be avoided if the combatant only makes a half move.

**Combat Maneuvers** A combatant can choose to trip, disarm, blind, or otherwise perform a dirty trick on his opponent. He makes an attack as normal. His opponent can choose to take damage as normal, or suffer the effects of the combat manuever.

### Saving Throws

Some effects require characters to make saving throws. To do so, roll a d20 and compare the result to the characterâs saving throw score on their character sheet. A result equal to or greater than the saving throw score is a success.

### Death & Healing

**Bind Wounds** Characters may bind their wounds after combat to restore 1 HP of damage sustained in that fight.

**Rest & Healing** Resting in camp for a night restores all HP (up to their maximum HP value).

**Deprivation** If a character is lacking food, water, or shelter, they are **deprived** and cannot regain HP.

**Grievous Wounds** When a combatant reaches 0 HP, they must make a saving throw. On a failure, they die. On a success, they are merely grievously wounded -- roll on the table below to determine their injuries. When grievously wounded, characters require a week's rest in camp or town to regain HP (instead of a night's rest).

| d6  | Grevious Wound                                                                                                 |
|:---:|:---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1   | **Gruesome Scars** -1 to reaction rolls.                                                                       |
| 2   | **Eye Gouged Out** Disadvantage on ranged attacks. If this happens twice, they are blinded.                    |
| 3   | **Broken Arm** Disadvantage to all actions with that arm / hand. Heals in 1d4 weeks.                         |
| 4   | **Broken Leg** Move speed and carrying capacity halved. Heals in 1d4 weeks.                                  |
| 5   | **Dismembered, Arm** Lose an arm.                                         |
| 6   | **Dismembered, Leg** Lose a leg. Move speed and carrying capacity halved. |

Table: Grevious Wounds

### Morale

When a side takes 50% casualties, make a morale check to see if they break. Roll 2d6; a result equal to or greater than the morale score means that the side routs and flees the field. Morale is usually based on the combatants experience level, per the table below.  

| Experience | Morale Roll to Rout | Examples              |
|:-----------|:------------:|:----------------------|
| Green      | 6+            | Conscripts, levy      |
| Trained    | 7+            | Militia, town guards  |
| Veteran    | 8+            | Experienced fighters  |
| Elite      | 9+            | Knights, house guards |

Table: Morale Scores

**Undead** are always hostile, never check morale, and normally cannot be reasoned with (intelligent undead such as liches are an exception).  

### Evasion

**Evasion & Initiative** If the party has the initiative, they can evade the monster automatically by retreating from the dungeon room or taking a circuitous wilderness path.

**Fleeing** If the party tries to flee, the monsters may give chase if the reaction roll indicates it. To successfully flee from a pursuer, the fleeing characters must each make a roll of 5+ on a d6. Encumbered characters have -1 on this roll. Unarmored characters have +1 on this roll. Failure means the monster catches up, and resumes its attack.

**Distractions** Food will always distract unintelligent monsters from the chase, by dropping 1 day's ration per monster HD. Treasure will always distract intelligent monsters from the chase, by dropping 100sp worth of treasure or coins per monster HD.  

**Secret Doors** Passing through a secret door will always evade a pursuer.

\newpage

## Dungeon Delving

### Turns

One turn of dungeon exploration takes about ten (10) minutes, and generally allows the party to take one action, such as:  

- Move to the next room
- Do something in the current room, such as:
  - Open a stuck or locked door
  - Search the current room
  - Rest and bind wounds
  - Interact with a feature of the room, such as a trap

### Dungeon Events

Every turn of exploration, or every time the party rests or makes excessive noise, roll a d6 on the event table below.

| d6 | Event |
|:--:|:---------|
| 1  | **Encounter** Roll an encounter on the appropriate wandering monster table.  |
| 2  | **Clue** Roll the next encounter on the appropriate wandering monster table and foreshadow it with a clue (sound, smell, or sight).  |
| 3  | **Exhaustion** Encumbered characters must spend a turn resting, without moving.   |
| 4  | **Light** A torch burns out.      |
| 5  | **Locality** The local state in the dungeon changes.   |
| 6  | **Free**, no effect   |

Table: Dungeon Event Rolls

### Doors

**Forcing Doors** All doors are stuck and must be burst open by force with a roll of 5+ on a d6. A failed attempt makes surprising whatever is behind the door impossible.

**Hear Noises** Characters can listen at doors and attempt to hear if the room is occupied on a roll of 5+ on a d6. Note that the undead make no sound.

**Secret doors** require the room they are in to be searched completely (takes one turn, sometimes more for larger rooms) Some doors are locked, and require a key or a thief to pick the lock to open.

**Spiking Doors** Doors will open freely for monsters unless wedged shut with iron spikes. When wedged shut, monsters must attempt to burst the door open as above, possibly giving the party time to hear them coming. Doors can also be wedged open with spikes, to ensure the party a clear path of escape.

**Holding Doors** Sometimes (especially during a chase) the party will try to hold a door against pursing monsters. The side trying to force a held door must try to burst it open as normal (5+ on a d6).

### Traps

**Room Traps** are activated on a roll of 1 or 2 on a d6. They can be detected by spending a turn searching the area. Thieves can attempt to disarm traps; but be careful, as a failure will trigger the trap. If the character doesn't want to risk this, find a clever way to bypass the trap.

**Treasure Traps** such as locks with poison needles, or a weighted plate underneath a statuette, can only be detected by a thief spending a turn searching the treasure. Thieves can attempt to disarm them, but failure will trigger the trap.

\newpage

## Wilderness Travel

### Timekeeping

**Watches** are a period of 8 hours. There are three (3) watches in a day. In summer, two (2) of these watches are daylight, and one (1) is nighttime. This is reversed in the winter months.  

During daylight watches, travelers can take one of the following actions as a group:

- Move 2d6 miles towards another area
- Do something in the current area, such as:
  - Hunt, fish, or forage for d3 rations of food or water (natural features permitting)
  - Explore the current area to reveal landmarks
  - Travel within the current area to a discovered landmark

Travelers must consume 1 unit of **supply** per person each day, or they become **deprived** and cannot regain HP. Travelers usually rest in camp overnight, but can conduct a forced march if needed (move 1d6 miles during a nighttime watch, and become **deprived**).

### Wilderness Events

Every watch of travel, roll a d6 on the event table below.

| d6 | Event |
|:--:|:---------|
| 1  | **Encounter** Roll an encounter on the appropriate wandering monster table.  |
| 2  | **Clue** Roll the next encounter on the appropriate wandering monster table and foreshadow it with a clue (sound, smell, or sight).  |
| 3  | **Exhaustion** Encumbered characters must spend a watch resting, without moving.   |
| 4  | **Lost** You are lost. Find a landmark to resume travel.     |
| 5  | **Weather** Roll a d6: (1-3) weather gets worse by one step, (4-6) weather gets better by one step.   |
| 6  | **Free**, no effect   |

Table: Wilderness Event Rolls

## Domains

At 9th level, a character can begin ruling their own domain. This might take the form of a fortress or manor house and its accompanying village for a fighter, a secluded tower or hut for a magic-user, a church or abbey for a cleric, or a hideout or tavern for a thief.

### Lord's Manor

Manors consist of the lord's keep (anything from a small fortified house, to an expansive castle, depending on the wealth of the lord) and the accompanying peasant population of the manor. The population density of a manor depends on the region in which the manor is located:

- Wilderness: d6-3 households per square mile
- Borderlands: d6 households per square mile
- Heartland: d6+3 households per square mile

The typical manor for a 9th level fighter is 2 to 3 square miles in size. If this is located in the borderlands, it will thus contain approximately 10 households.

Each household generates 1 sp in productive capacity every month. This consists mainly of food, cloth, and labor, rather than pure cash. The peasantry are typically taxed at 10%; higher taxation rates are possible but require a 2d6 roll to avoid an uprising. This is modifed by the lord's **Charisma** bonus.

| Tax Rate | Uprising on... |
|---|---|
| 10% | happy, no uprising |
| 15% | 10+ |
| 20% | 9+ |
| 25% | 8+ |
| 30% | 7+ |

Table: Peasant Uprisings

Peasants can provide one (1) levy (as light foot, 1HD, morale 6+) per household in times of war. Levy will serve for 6 weeks unpaid (though they must be supplied with food, either by their lord or through forage); beyond that, they must be paid wages as mercenaries or they immediately disperse. Even if paid, make a morale roll each week to see if they return to their farms regardless.

### Wizard's Tower

### Abbot's Abbey

### Master Thief's Hideout

## Mass Combat

Each turn of mass combat, roll one (1) d6 per HD of creatures in the units in combat. A unit deals a hit on a result based on the DR of its enemy:

| DR | Hit on... |
|---|---|
| 0 | 3+ |
| 1 | 4+ |
| 2 | 5+ |
| 3 | 6+ |

Table: Mass Combat Hits

Each hit removes one enemy HD from combat as a casualty. Check morale as normal. Casualties check for survival with a result of 3+ on a d6 after combat. If they survive, they are **greviously wounded**.

## Appendix

### Monsters by HD

Monsters are able to see in complete darkness. When converting monsters from other publications, their saving throw and to-hit bonus should be based on the number of HD. A monsterâs saving throw is found by subtracting itâs HD from 19 (for example, a 2 HD monster has a saving throw of 17). A monster has a to-hit bonus equal to its HD. HD should be converted to d6. Monsters typically deal d6 damage per attack, though particularly dangerous monsters might deal more.
