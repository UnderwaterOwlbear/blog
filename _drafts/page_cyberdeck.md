# Design Goals

## Mandatory

1. Full-size keyboard (since I'll mostly be interfacing with a terminal)
2. Raspberry Pi based (specifically the RPi 3 B that's sitting in my basement)
3. Linux (probably the stock Raspbian distro)
4. Battery pack with charger
5. Doesn't require a 3D printer for build

## Optional

1. Mechanical keyboard
2. Foldable
3. Aesthetically pleasing
4. Trackball
