I wanted to take a look at the 3.5e and 5e versions of the Great Wheel cosmology's Outer Planes, and rework them slightly to fit my more sword-and-sorcery preferences. Here are the planes as they stand in 3.5e:

| Plane       | Alignment | Theme                              |
|-------------|-----------|------------------------------------|
| Ysgard      | CG/CN     | Battle, Vikings, Valhalla          |
| Limbo       | CN        | Primordial chaos, elemental forces |
| Pandemonium | CN/CE     | Wind, madness, tunnels             |
| Abyss       | CE        | Demons                             |
| Carceri     | CE/NE     | Prisons                            |
| Hades       | NE        | Evil, despair, entrapping          |
| Gehenna     | NE/LE     | Volcanoes                          |
| Baator      | LE        | Hell, devils, fire and brimstone   |
| Acheron     | LE/LN     | Warfare, cubes                     |
| Mechanus    | LN        | Clockwork                          |
| Arcadia     | LN/LG     | Harmony, order                     |
| Celestia    | LG        | Heaven, angels, mountain           |
| Bytopia     | LG/NG     | Twin planes, bucolic               |
| Elysium     | NG        | Nature, beauty, entrapping         |
| Beastlands  | NG/CG     | Wilderness, hunting, animals       |
| Arborea     | CG        | Nature, forests                    |
| Outlands    | N         | Neutrality, Sigil                  |

I think this list can be simplified, made to comply with the OGL, and expanded with some other free-use planes.

- Gehenna and Baator can be combined into one "hellish" fire-and-brimstone plane.  
- Ysgard and Acheron can be combined into one "battle" plane
- Limbo and the Abyss can be combined into one "chaos" plane
- Arborea, the Beastlands, and Elysium can be combined into one "wilderness" plane
- Carceri and Hades can be combined into one "death / prison" plane
- Mechanus, Arcadia, and Celestia can be combined into one "heavenly / order" plane
- Pandemonium can stay as a "madness" plane.
- The Outlands will be removed, since they mostly facilitated the Planescape setting (which isn't the tone I'm going for).

That leaves us with this cosmology:

- Hellish
- Battle
- Chaos
- Wilderness
- Death
- Heavenly
- Madness

Let's examine each in a little more detail.

## Hellish Plane

This is a fusion of Gehenna and Baator from 3.5e. Gehenna is a real name, from Judaism, and is a place [associated with purgatory and punishment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valley_of_Hinnom_(Gehenna)#Rabbinical_Judaism). Baator is an invented name from the DnD franchise. The levels of Baator are mostly drawn from real sources:

1. [**Avernus**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avernus): from the Greek entrance to the underworld, or the underworld itself.
2. [**Dis**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dis_(Divine_Comedy)): from the fortified city of hell in Dante's *Divine Comedy*, where the unpardonable sinners are punished.
3. **Minauros**: possibly a corruption of the name *Minos*, the judge of hell seen in the [second circle of hell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_circle_of_hell) in Dante's *Divine Comedy* (who himself is the same [Minos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minos) seen in the myth of Theseus).
4. [**Phlegethos**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phlegethon): from the Greek *Phlegethon*, a river of fire in the underworld.
5. [**Stygia**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Styx) from the Greek *Styx*, another river in the underworld.
6. [**Malbolge**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malebolge): from the cavern where sinners who committed fraud were punished in Dante's *Divine Comedy*.
7. **Maladomini**
8. **Cania**
9. [**Nessus**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nessus_(mythology)#In_popular_culture): this name originates in Greek mythology and is the name of a centaur, whose blood was poisoned by an arrow laced with hydra venom. However, Gygax probably got the name from the centaur's appearance in Dante's [*Inferno*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inferno_(Dante)#Seventh_Circle_(Violence)) (drink!). My headcanon, however, is that this circle of hell resembles the eponymous city in Gene Wolfe's *Book of the New Sun*.
