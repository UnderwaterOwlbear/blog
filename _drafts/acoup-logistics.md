Useful notes and rules of thumb from various AOUP posts.

[New Acquisitions: How Fast Do Armies Move?](https://acoup.blog/2019/10/06/new-acquisitions-how-fast-do-armies-move/)

ACW brigade of 3,000 men...

- Road 13ft wide
- Column is 4,000 ft long
- 1 mule per 6-8 men
- 20 wagons per 1,000 men
- 80 wagons per mile of road
- Wagon train takes up 4,000 more ft
- Total length 1.5 miles

Move 8-12 miles per day, rule of thumb. Avg 10 miles per day. Smaller armies are towards top end of this. Large armies low end or lower.

Mongols / horse nomads can manage long-distance horseback riding at 60 miles per day.

Theoden manages 100 miles over 2 days in a forced ride with unencumbered cavalry and good roads. Bret notes this as reasonable.

Castles / fortresses with garrisoned cavalry deny enemy columns the opportunity to forage. Foot can only carry 10 days foot on their backs. Thus castles constrain the operational range of enemy armies.

Rome needed to import 80 million kg of wheat per year for 200,000 households.

10 mile long columns are barely manageable. Preferably would be shorter. Needs to be shorter than the daily marching distance of 8-12 miles.

(Note: combining with above of 1.5 miles per 3,000 men, means that armies can operate in columns of 15,000 to 24,000 men max. Probably kept to 10,000 or less)

Wagon Train Rules of thumb:

- Wagons hold 1,400 lb of food pulled by 2 horses. 
- 1 wagon and 2 horses per 20 soldiers --> means 50 wagons and 100 horses per 1,000 men. Close-ish to 20 per 1,000 above? I think ACW wagons were larger.
- 3 lb of food per day per man.
- 10 lb of food per day per horse (if grazing available)
- 20 lb of food per day per horse (if not)
- 1 soldier can carry 10 days food (30 lb)
- 1 wagon needs 1 man (3 lb) and 2 horses (20 lb) to drive. Eat 23lb per day. Can carry 1,400 lb. 

Wagons vs men endurance table is thus (in days): 

| men              | wagons |    |    |     |      |
|------------------|--------|----|----|-----|------|
|                  |      0 |  1 | 10 | 100 | 1000 |
|                0 |      0 | 61 | 61 |  61 |   61 |
|                1 |     10 | 55 | 60 |  61 |   61 |
|               10 |     10 | 32 | 55 |  60 |   61 |
|               20 |     10 | 24 | 50 |  60 |   61 |
|               50 |     10 | 17 | 41 |  58 |   61 |
|              100 |     10 | 14 | 32 |  55 |   60 |
|             1000 |     10 | 10 | 14 |  32 |   55 |
|            10000 |     10 | 10 | 10 |  14 |   32 |

Diminishing returns of adding wagons **(or, the tyranny of the wagon equation).**

Rules of thumb above from ACW and GoT examples give operational endurances of ~20 days (about double that of soldiers without wagon train).

Forage Rules of Thumb:

- Sweep 5 miles in either direction of route = 80-120 sq mi per day.
- Collect 10% of food production without triggering starvation (25 kg / 55 lb per farmer). 

Those lead to this forage table:

| historicity in medieval | pop. density (farmers / sq mi) | famers stolen from | food foraged (lb) | army size supported (assume 1 wagon & 2 horses / 20 men) |
