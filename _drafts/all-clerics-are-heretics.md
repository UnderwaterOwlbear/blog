Setting idea to spice up standard DnD clerics.

All PC clerics are heretical.

The rest of the NPCs are generally the Catholic-church expy of typical vanilla DnD settings. But PC clerics are explicitly not allowed to be a part of that faith. Why? Because if they were, they would be suborned into the ecclesiastical apparatus and be ordered to spend their time ministering to peasants or being anchorites or something, instead of adventuring.
