## Combat

---

**Reaction Rolls**: When encountering a wandering monster or other entity, and their disposition is unknown, roll 2d6 to determine their reaction.

| 2d6  | Reaction     |
|:----:|:-------------|
| 2-   | Hostile      |
| 3-5  | Negative     |
| 6-8  | Uncertain    |
| 9-11 | Positive     |
| 12+  | Enthusiastic |

Table: Reaction Roll Results

**Initiative**: Characters must make a successful **DEX** save to gain the initiative and act before their enemies. On each of their turns, a character may move a short distance and take one other action, such as:

* Move further
* Attack
* Interact with an object

**Attacking**: To attack, roll your weapon's damage die, and subtract any Armor that your target possesses. You deal that much damage to your target's **HP**.

**Critical Damage**: Damage that reduces a target’s **HP** below zero decreases a target’s **STR** by the amount remaining. They must then make a **STR** save to avoid **critical damage**.

* Any PC that suffers critical damage cannot do anything but crawl weakly, grasping for life. If given aid and rest, they will stabilize. If left untreated, they die within the hour.
* Additionally, some enemies will have special abilities or effects that are triggered when their target fails a critical damage save.

**Enhanced & Impaired**: If your attack is **enhanced**, increase the die size by one step. If it is **impaired**, decrease the die size by one step.

**Charge**: In the first round of combat, a combatant may charge an enemy by moving from outside of melee range to within melee range of an enemy in the movement phase. The charging combatant deals **enhanced** damage on their next attack against the charged enemy.
**Blast**: Attacks with the **blast** quality affect all targets in the noted area, rolling separately for each affected character. If unsure how many targets can be affected, roll the related damage die for a result.

**Maneuvers**: A combatant can choose to trip, disarm, blind, or otherwise perform a dirty trick on his opponent. He makes an attack as normal. His opponent can choose to take damage as normal, or suffer the effects of the combat manuever.

**Withdraw**: When a combatant within melee range of an enemy moves out of melee range, the enemy may immediately make a melee attack against the combatant. This can be avoided if the combatant only makes a half move.

## Morale & Fleeing

---

**Morale**: Enemies must pass a **WIL** save to avoid fleeing when they take their first casualty and again when they lose half their number. Some groups may use their leader's **WIL** in place of their own. Lone foes must save when they're reduced to 0 **HP**. Morale does not affect PCs.

**Undead** are always hostile, never check morale, and normally cannot be reasoned with (intelligent undead such as liches or vampires are an exception).  

**Flee**: Running away from a dire situation always requires a successful **DEX** save, as well as a safe destination to run to. If you are mounted and your pursuers are not, you automatically succeed at fleeing.

**Distraction**: Food will always distract unintelligent monsters from the chase, by dropping 1 day's ration per monster. Treasure will always distract intelligent monsters from the chase, by dropping 100sp worth of treasure or coins per monster.  

**Secret Passages**: Passing through a secret door will always evade a pursuer.

## Death & Healing

---

If a PC's **STR** is reduced to 0, they die. If their **DEX** is reduced to 0, they are paralyzed. If their **WIL** is reduced to 0, they are delirious.

Ability scores and **HP** are restored by resting:

* **Short rest**: Takes a few minutes in a safe, well-lit area. Heal all **HP**.
* **Long rest**: Takes a night in camp and a **ration**. Heal all **HP** and heal d6 of one **ability score**.
* **Full rest**: Takes a week in town and paying for room and board (usually 20sp). Heal all **HP** and all **ability scores**.

## Dungeon Delving

---

**The Clock**: When you enter the dungeon, the clock starts at 20 (use a spindown d20 from *MTG* for this). Each turn, roll a d6 and subtract the result from the clock. When the clock hits 0, a wandering monster is encountered and the clock resets to 20.

**Turns**: One turn of dungeon exploration takes about ten (10) minutes, and generally allows the party to take one action, such as:  

* Move to the next room
* Do something in the current room, such as:
  * Open a stuck or locked **door**
  * Search the current room thoroughly, revealing **traps** and **secret doors**      * Take a **short rest**
  * Interact with a feature of the room, such as a **trap**

**Fleeing the Dungeon**: When the party flees back to camp in disarray (as opposed to an orderly withdrawal), each character must make a save against **DEX** and **WIL**. If the **DEX** save is failed, they lose 1d6x10% of treasure obtained. If the **WIL** save is failed, they take 1d6 **WIL** damage.

## Doors

---

**Hear Noise**: Characters can listen at doors and attempt to hear if the room is occupied. Note that the undead make no sound.

**Forcing Doors**: All doors are stuck and must be burst open by force with a successful **STR** save. A failed attempt makes surprising whatever is behind the door impossible.

**Locked Doors**: Some doors are locked, and require a key or a successful **DEX** save to pick the lock to open.

**Secret Doors**: Secret doors require the room they are in to be searched completely (takes one turn, sometimes more for larger rooms).

**Spiking Doors**: Doors will open freely for monsters unless wedged shut with iron spikes. When wedged shut, monsters must attempt to burst the door open as above, possibly giving the party time to hear them coming. Doors can also be wedged open with spikes, to ensure the party a clear path of escape.

**Holding Doors**: Sometimes (especially during a chase) the party will try to hold a door against pursing monsters. The side trying to force a held door must try to burst it open as normal.

## Traps

---

**Room Traps**:  Room traps are activated on a failed **DEX** save. They can be detected by spending a turn searching the area. Thieves can attempt to disarm traps; but be careful, as a failure will trigger the trap. If the character doesn't want to risk this, find a clever way to bypass the trap. Traps deal damage directly to an **ability score** on a failed save.

**Treasure Traps**: Treasure traps such as locks with poison needles, or a weighted plate underneath a statuette, can only be detected by a thief spending a turn searching the treasure. Thieves can attempt to disarm them, but failure will trigger the trap. Traps deal damage directly to an **ability score** on a failed save.

## Wilderness Travel

---

**Timekeeping**: Wilderness travel turns take place over turns of one day in length. Each day, travelers may take one of the following actions:

* Move 2d6+8 miles towards another area
* Hunt, fish, or forage for d3 rations of food or water (natural features permitting)
* Explore the current area to reveal landmarks
* Travel within the current area to a discovered landmark
