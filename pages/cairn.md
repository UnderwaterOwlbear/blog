## Character Creation

Start with the following:

* 3d6 FORTITUDE
* 3d6 REFLEX
* 3d6 WILL
* 1d6 HP
* Roll a d6 on the table below for each column to determine the rest of your starting gear:
    * Gain +1 to Armor roll if FORTITUDE > 12
    * Gain +1 to Weapons roll if REFLEX > 12
    * Gain +1 to Gear roll if WILL > 12
* Roll a d6 for rare languages known
    * 3 or less, no rare languages known (English only)
    * 4 or 5, one rare language known
    * 6, two rare languages known

| d6 | Armor               | Weapons                       | Gear                        |
|----|---------------------|-------------------------------|-----------------------------|
| 1  | None                | Staff (d6, *2H*) & Sling (d4) | Hammer & Spikes (6)         |
| 2  | None                | Mace (d6) & Shield (+1 ARMOR) | Torches (3) & Tinderbox     |
| 3  | None                | Daggers, two (2d4)            | Shovel & Pickaxe            |
| 4  | Padded (1 ARMOR)    | Axe (d6) & Shield (+1 ARMOR)  | Rope, 50 ft                 |
| 5  | Padded (1 ARMOR)    | Spear (d8, *2H*)              | Lockpicks                   |
| 6  | Padded (1 ARMOR)    | Bow (d8) & Arrows             | Mule                        |
| 7  | Chainmail (2 ARMOR) | Sword (d8)                    | Random spellbook (roll d20) |

### Rare Languages

* Gnomish - The language of gnomes, cats, small mammals, and songbirds.
* Black Speech - The language of the enemy.
* Pirate - The language of criminals, sailors, street musicians, Vikings, clowns, and other disreputable types.
* Liturgical - The language of the Church, their Demons, and the Undead.
* Ogham - A language found scarred into old birch trees. No known speakers.

---

## Saving Throws

When doing something risky, a character must make a save by rolling a d20 under the appropriate saving throw score to succeed.

* FORTITUDE for tests of strength or endurance.
* REFLEX for tests of agility or precision.
* WILL for tests of concentration, battles of will, or interactions with magic.

---

## Experience & Advancement

Gain 1 XP for every coins spent on carousing, partying, donating, gambling, or other pursuits without material reward. Slaying monsters may award XP as well, but this is significantly more dangerous and less rewarding than stealing treasure.

When a character gains a level, do the following:

1. Roll 1d20 for each save. If it is greater than or equal to the ability score, increase that score by 1.
2. Increase HP by +1

| Level | XP      |
|-------|--------:|
| 1     | 0       |
| 2     | 2,000   |
| 3     | 4,000   |
| 4     | 8,000   |
| 5     | 16,000  |
| 6     | 32,000  |
| 7     | 64,000  |
| 8     | 128,000 |
| 9     | 256,000 |

## Encumbrance

Characters can choose how encumbered they are, and what they are encumbered with, from the following options:

1. **Unencumbered** - The character is only carrying their fighting kit (weapons, armor, spellbook, holy symbol, thieves tools, etc) and a few personal trinkets (magic rings, treasure map, anything that can be stuffed into a pocket).
    * Benefits: Always act before monsters (don't need to make a REFLEX save).
    * Drawbacks: None.
2. **Encumbered with Supplies** - The character is carrying their fighting kit, trinkets, and a backpack full of supplies (rations, waterskins, torches, iron spikes, rope, etc).
    * Benefits: Can carry 2 weeks of supplies for wilderness travel, and reduces the amount the Dungeon Clock decreases each turn (1d6 is rolled instead of 1d8).
    * Drawbacks: Must succeed on a REFLEX saving throw to act before monsters.
3. **Encumbered with Treasure** - The character is carrying their fighting kit, trinkets, and a backpack full of treasure (gold coins, gemstones, jewelry, statuettes, etc).
    * Benefits: Can convert the treasure into 2d6x100 coins in town.
    * Drawbacks: Must succeed on a REFLEX saving throw to act before monsters.

Beasts of burden are usually encumbered with either supplies or treasure.

## Basic Combat

**Reaction Rolls**: When encountering a wandering monster or other entity, and their disposition is unknown, make a linguistic skill check. On a success, they are at least neutral. On a failure, or if you do not know the language, they are hostile.

**Initiative**: Characters must make a successful REFLEX save to gain the initiative and act before their enemies. On each of their turns, a character may move a short distance and take one other action, such as:

* Move further
* Attack
* Interact with an object

**Attacking**: To attack, roll your weapon's damage die, and subtract any ARMOR that your target possesses. You deal that much damage to your target's HP.

**Critical Damage**: DAMAGE that reduces a target’s HP below zero decreases a target’s FORTITUDE by the amount remaining. They must then make a FORTITUDE save to avoid CRITICAL DAMAGE.

* Any PC that suffers CRITICAL DAMAGE cannot do anything but crawl weakly, grasping for life. If given aid and rest, they will stabilize. If left untreated, they die within the hour.
* Additionally, some enemies will have special abilities or effects that are triggered when their target fails a CRITICAL DAMAGE save.

---

## Advanced Combat

**Multiple Attacks**: If multiple damage dice are rolled against the same target (whether by dual wielding, multiple attackers, etc), only the highest result deals damage.

**Blast**: Attacks with the blast quality affect all targets in the noted area, rolling separately for each affected character. If unsure how many targets can be affected, roll the related damage die for a result.

**Stunts**: A combatant can choose to trip, disarm, blind, or otherwise perform a dirty trick on his opponent. He makes an attack as normal. His opponent can choose to take damage as normal, or suffer the effects of the combat manuever.

---

## Morale & Fleeing

**Morale**: Enemies must pass a WILL save to avoid fleeing when they take their first casualty and again when they lose half their number. Some groups may use their leader's WILL in place of their own. Lone foes must save when they're reduced to 0 HP. Morale does not affect PCs.

**Undead** are always hostile, never check morale, and normally cannot be reasoned with (intelligent undead such as liches or vampires are an exception).  

**Flee**: Running away from a dire situation always requires a successful REFLEX save, as well as a safe destination to run to. If you are mounted and your pursuers are not, you automatically succeed at fleeing.

**Distraction**: Food will always distract unintelligent monsters from the chase, by dropping 1 day's ration per monster. Treasure will always distract intelligent monsters from the chase, by dropping 100sp worth of treasure or coins per monster.  

**Secret Passages**: Passing through a secret door will always evade a pursuer.

---

## Death & Healing

If a PC's FORTITUDE is reduced to 0, they die. If their REFLEX is reduced to 0, they are paralyzed. If their WILL is reduced to 0, they are delirious.

Ability scores and HP are restored by resting:

* **Short rest**: Takes a few minutes in a safe, well-lit area. Heal all HP.
* **Long rest**: Takes a night in camp and a ration. Heal all HP and heal d6 of one ability score.
* **Full rest**: Takes a week in town and paying for room and board (usually 20sp). Heal all HP and all ability scores.

---

## Dungeon Delving

**The Clock**: When you enter the dungeon, the clock starts at 20 (use a spindown d20 from *MtG* for this). Each turn, roll 1d8 and subtract the result from the clock. When the clock hits 0, a wandering monster is encountered and the clock resets to 20.

**Turns**: One turn of dungeon exploration takes about ten minutes, and generally allows the party to take one action, such as:  

* Open a stuck or locked door
* Search the room thoroughly, revealing traps and secret doors
* Take a short rest
* Interact with a feature of the room, such as a trap
* Move to the next room

**Darkness**: When the party does not have a light source, 1d10 is rolled against the dungeon clock each turn instead of 1d8, and they are unable to find traps or secret doors regardless of time spent searching.

**Light Sources**: Torches, candles, lamps, or the like require a free hand to hold them. One such light source is required for every 4 dungeon explorers.

**Fleeing the Dungeon**: When the party flees back to camp in disarray (as opposed to an orderly withdrawal), each character must make a save against REFLEX and WILL. If the REFLEX save is failed, they lose 1d6x10% of treasure obtained. If the WILL save is failed, they take 1d6 WILL damage.

---

## Doors

**Hear Noise**: Characters can listen at doors and attempt to hear if the room is occupied. Note that the undead make no sound.

**Forcing Doors**: All doors are stuck and must be burst open by force with a successful FORTITUDE save. A failed attempt makes surprising whatever is behind the door impossible.

**Locked Doors**: Some doors are locked, and require a key or a successful lockpicking attempt (5+ on a d6, takes one turn) to pick the lock to open. A failed lockpicking attempt means that the lock is jammed and cannot be picked again.

**Secret Doors**: Secret doors can be discovered by searching the room.

**Spiking Doors**: Doors will open freely for monsters and swing shut of their own accord, unless wedged with iron spikes. When wedged shut, monsters must attempt to burst the door open as above, possibly giving the party time to hear them coming. Doors can also be wedged open with spikes, to ensure the party a clear path of escape.

**Holding Doors**: Sometimes (especially during a chase) the party will try to hold a door against pursing monsters. The side trying to force a held door must try to burst it open as normal.

---

## Traps

**Room Traps**:  Room traps are activated on a roll of 5+ on a d6. They can be detected by spending a turn searching the area. Characters can attempt to disarm traps; but be careful, as a failure will trigger the trap. If the character doesn't want to risk this, find a clever way to bypass the trap. Traps deal damage directly to an ability score on a failed save.

**Treasure Traps**: Treasure traps such as locks with poison needles, or a weighted plate underneath a statuette, can only be detected by spending a turn searching the treasure. Characters can attempt to disarm them, but failure will trigger the trap. Traps deal damage directly to an ability score on a failed save.

---

## Tunnelling

One man can move a 5x5x5ft cube of dirt every 2 hours, or the same volume of rock every 4 hours. The appropriate tools such as pickaxes and shovels are required.

Tunnels can be crawled through slowly if they measure 5x5ft, or walked through normally if they are 10x10ft.

---

## Wilderness Travel

Wilderness travel turns take place over turns of one day in length. Each day, the party may take one of the following actions:

* Move 2d6+8 miles towards another area
* Explore the current area to reveal landmarks
* Hunt and forage to recieve d4-2 days of food and water (natural features permitting).
* Travel within the current area to a discovered landmark

---

## Spellcasting

**Spellbooks** contain a single spell. Anyone can cast a spell by holding a spellbook in both hands and reading its contents aloud.

**Spell Level**: A spell's effective caster level is equal to the amount of WILL damage the caster inflicts upon himself. This WILL damage can be healed with rests just as with any other ability score damage. The max spell level is 6th (and thus max WILL damage that can be inflicted this way is 6 damage).

**Scrolls** are similar to Spellbooks, however they burn to ash after one use, and are always cast at 1st level.

**Casting**: Unless otherwise specified, spells take 1 action to cast and require two free hands.

**Duration**: Unless otherwise specified, spell effects last for 10 minutes per spell level.  

**Counterspells**: Any spellbook may be cast as a *counterspell* instead of it's normal spell. A counterspell protects one person per spell level from the effects of one spell.  

---

## Spell Descriptions

1. **Animate Dead**: Animate a number of undead equal to spell level. Roll d6 when spell ends: (1-3) undead become hostile, (4-5) undead collapse into dust, (6) undead serve the caster permanently.
2. **Augury**: Perform a divination to determine whether a given course of action will result in "weal" or "woe". The caster may ask one question per level. DM rolls a d6 secretly: on a 4+, the answer is truthful. Sacrifice 1d6 FORTITUDE in blood to guarantee a truthful answer.
3. **Charm**: Hostile creatures become neutral, neutral become friendly, and friendly creatures become infatuated. Affects a number of creatures equal to spell level.
4. **Circle of Protection**: Draw a circle on the ground with chalk, salt, or blood. Undead, fey, demons, or other unnatural creatures cannot cross the boundary. Protects one creature per spell level.
5. **Control Weather**: Control the weather, causing clear skies, storms, winds, etc as desired. Effects last for 1 day per spell level.
6. **Dominate**: Release control of your own body and domineer that of a nearby creature. Subject saves to prevent.
7. **Fireball**: Deals 1d6 fire damage per spell level to all targets in a small area (such as a melee or a room). Targets save for half damage.
8. **Fly**: Fly at walking speed. Affects one creature per level. Spell is reliable for 10 minutes per spell level, then has a chance to end on each subsequent turn on a roll of 5+ on a d6.
9. **Hold Person**: Paralyzes a number of creatures equal to spell level. Subjects save to avoid.
10. **Invisibility**: Turn one creature per spell level invisible.
11. **Knock**: Open one stuck or locked door within arm's reach.

14. **Sleep**: Puts all within a small area (such as a melee, or a room) into a deep slumber. Subjects save to avoid.
15. **Speak with Dead**: Ask 1d6 questions of the corpse of a deceased intelligent creature. Reaction rolls apply and negotiation may be required. Corpse may be dead for a period of time based on spell level...

    | Spell Level | Deceased for... |
    |-------------|-----------------|
    | 1st         | 1 week          |
    | 2nd         | 1 month         |
    | 3rd         | 1 year          |

17. **Tongues**: You can comprehend all written and spoken languages.
18. **Water Breathing**: Can breathe under water for 10 minutes per spell level. Affects one creature per spell level.
19. **Wind Barrier**: Buffeting winds prevent missile attacks from harming those within. Protects one creature per spell level.
20. **Wizard Lock**: Locks one door, chest, window, or similar portal. Requires a *knock* spell or similar magic to open.

---

## Monster Conversion

HP = HD + 3 (default to d6 if unsure)  
FORTITUDE, REFLEX, and WILL default to 10 each. Increment by +/-4 if particularly strong, brave, agile, etc.  
**Attacks**: Use same die type. Multiple attacks are rolled as normal, but only the highest die deals damage.  
**ARMOR**: Lightly armored or naturally armored monsters have ARMOR 1 or 2. Particularly impervious monsters (dragon scales, etc) have ARMOR 3.  
**Morale**: *B/X*-style morale scores can be converted to WILL per the following table:

| B/X Morale | WILL score |
|------------|-----------|
| 2          | 1         |
| 3          | 2         |
| 4          | 3         |
| 6          | 7         |
| 7          | 9         |
| 8          | 13        |
| 9          | 15        |
| 10         | 18        |
| 11         | 19        |
| 12         | 20        |
