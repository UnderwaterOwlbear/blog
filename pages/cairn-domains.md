### Lord's Manor

**Manors**  
Manors consist of the lord's keep (anything from a small fortified house, to an expansive castle, depending on the wealth of the lord) and the accompanying peasant population of the manor. The population density of a manor depends on the region in which the manor is located:

- **Wilderness**: d6-3 households per square mile
- **Borderlands**: d6 households per square mile
- **Heartland**: d6+3 households per square mile

The typical manor for a minor lord is 2 to 3 square miles in size. If this is located in the borderlands, it will thus contain approximately 10 households.

**Castles**  
Castles cost ~80,000 coins and take an amount of time to build equal to sqrt(cost), or approximately 5 and a half years for a 80,000-coin castle.

**Taxes**  
Each household generates 1 coin in productive capacity every month. This consists mainly of food, cloth, and labor, rather than pure cash. The peasantry are typically taxed at 10%; higher taxation rates are possible but require a 2d6 roll to avoid an uprising.

| Tax Rate | Uprising on... |
|---|---|
| 10% | happy, no uprising |
| 15% | 10+ |
| 20% | 9+ |
| 25% | 8+ |
| 30% | 7+ |

**Levies**  
Peasants can provide one (1) levy (**HP** d4 **WIL** 7) per household in times of war. Levy will serve for 6 weeks unpaid (though they must be supplied with food, either by their lord or through forage); beyond that, they must be paid wages as mercenaries or they immediately disperse. Even if paid, make a **WIL** save each week to see if they return to their farms.
